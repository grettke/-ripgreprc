# Try to keep everything simple, consistent, and predictable. Every option
# falls into atleast one of those buckets. It is worth slowing it down to keep
# working like that.

# Out of the box rg doesn't work like grep does searching every directory.
# Specifically the dot-directories. This is unexpected behavior so add it back.

--hidden

# Out of the box rg also knows to ignore Git's own data directory in addition
# to Git's ignores that the user sets up. Since ~--hidden~ forces rg to search
# *every* directory, including Git's data directory, we have to teach rg to
# ignore Git's data directory. Add that configuration in a file to accomodate
# further changes.

--ignore-file=/Users/grant/src/ripgreprc/ignore-file.rc

# Sort results by file name. This is easier when you expect a certain file
# name prefix: you scan directly to that location in the results. This disables
# parallelism and slows it down.

--sort=path

# "If you prefer to keep ripgrep's binary file detection consistent, then you can disable
# memory map"
